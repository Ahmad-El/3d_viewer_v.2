# 3D Viewer with MVC, Singleton, Strategy, and Facade Patterns

## Introduction

Welcome to the 3D Viewer project! This application is a simple yet powerful tool for viewing and interacting with 3D models. It's built in C++ using the OpenGL graphic library for rendering and the Qt framework for the graphical user interface (GUI). The project follows design patterns such as MVC (Model-View-Controller), Singleton, Strategy, and Facade to achieve a modular and maintainable architecture.

## Features

- **3D Model Rendering**: Utilizes OpenGL for efficient and high-performance rendering of 3D models.
- **MVC Architecture**: Separates concerns into Model, View, and Controller components for better organization and scalability.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single instance of critical classes, promoting resource efficiency and consistent behavior.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Allows for flexible rendering strategies, enabling users to choose different rendering approaches.
- **Facade Pattern**: Simplifies complex subsystem interactions, providing a unified interface for the user.
